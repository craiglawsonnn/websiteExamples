# Simple Portfolio Website - Roadmap

## Overview
This project involves creating a simple, minimalistic website to showcase three website templates, each with different features, and includes a contact form for potential customers to get in touch. The design is clean and focused, using modular sections and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Milestones

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Repository Initialization
1. **Set Up GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for the project.
   - Add a `.gitignore` file for ignoring unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).
   - Initialize the repository with a `README.md` to describe the project.

2. **Set Up Local Development Environment**
   - Set up the development environment (more details in the second part of the answer).
   - Create a basic file structure: 
     - `index.html`
     - `styles.css`
     - A folder for each template preview: `template1.html`, `template2.html`, `template3.html`
     - `contact.html` (optional if using a form on the landing page)

### Phase 2: Build the Website Structure

1. **Create a Clean Landing Page**
   - Add the **header** with a simple logo and navigation bar (Home, Templates, Contact).
   - Add a **headline** (e.g., "Choose Your Website Template").
   - Display **three templates** as cards or sections:
     - Each template should have a brief description and a "Preview" button that links to a demo page.
     - Make use of high-quality images or mockups to represent the templates.

2. **Template Preview Pages**
   - For each template, create a preview page with:
     - A clean mockup or live demo of the template.
     - Description of features (bulleted list or icon-based features).
     - Call to action (e.g., "I want this template!" button leading to contact).

3. **Build the Contact Form**
   - Include fields like **Name**, **Email**, and **Message**.
   - Create a simple backend using **Node.js/Express** or just an email submission service (like **Formspree** or **EmailJS**).

### Phase 3: Add Design & Styling

1. **CSS Styling (Minimalistic Design)**
   - Implement a minimal color scheme (white, light gray, accent color).
   - Use **flexbox** or **CSS grid** to create a responsive design for all sections.
   - Keep typography simple and consistent with one or two fonts (e.g., Helvetica, Montserrat).

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the layout works across different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) by using media queries.
   - Adjust padding, font sizes, and image sizes for smaller screens.

### Phase 4: Feature Enhancements

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Test the website on mobile devices and tablets. Use media queries in CSS to ensure a seamless experience.

2. **Add Basic Animations**
   - Add smooth hover effects on buttons and links.
   - Use CSS transitions to create subtle fade-in effects as the user scrolls down.

3. **Optimize the Website**
   - Minimize the size of assets (e.g., images).
   - Add lazy loading for images to ensure fast load times.

### Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing**
   - Perform end-to-end testing across browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure compatibility.
   - Ensure that forms are working correctly and submissions are being sent.

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the site on **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages**.
   - Ensure the website is live and share the GitHub repo link for tracking changes.

### Future Improvements
- Add Google Analytics for tracking user visits and engagement.
- Include a blog or testimonial section for showcasing client feedback.
- Add more templates or customization options for the templates.
